# Project1
This is a project that implements custom system calls in a Linux system.

1. The first system call returns the linear address and physical address corresponding to the value of a global variable.
2. The second system call takes an array of size 2,000,000 as input and retrieves the linear address and physical address of the 0th and 1,999,999th values.

A complete explanation of the implementation can be found in HankMD.
